## Installation
Code, especially those in `tuning-PoC.py` depends on changes not yet merged into the upstream [iracepy](https://github.com/auto-optimization/iracepy) and [irace](https://github.com/MLopez-Ibanez/irace). So if you want to run it you need to install `iracepy` with 

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/DE0CH/iracepy@main
```

And install the R package `DE0CH/irace` [from Github](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/githubinstall/vignettes/githubinstall.html).
